# How to run
Place your cpp file in the main folder, then use the command:
```python3 tester.py *name of your program*.cpp```

For more options:
```python3 tester.py -h```

## Description
This program works based on differential fuzzing.

## How to make your own tests with this program
In the workingPrograms folder there needs to be at least one (there can be more) compiled program for which you are decently certain gives the correct solution.
I will be updating this repository to have my version of the program included.

The program will always be updated to test the latest assignment given. This can be changed with the ```-a``` argument.
