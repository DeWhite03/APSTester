# APS Tester

This program will generate an infinite amount of randomized outputs (with preference for low and high extremes). It will feed these inputs into multiple verified working programs and into your program, then compare the results to determine whether your solution is valid.

There is no user input, everything is handled through the file "settings".

# Setup

In the "settings" file, input the name of the compiled working program.
Input the structure of the input and the bounds.
An example is already written in "settings".

To run, use:
APStester.py *your program name*.cpp
